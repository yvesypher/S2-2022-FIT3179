        <p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: -20px">Established in 1901, Nobel Prize is a prestigious
          annual award for outstanding achievement in such fields as Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Peace,
          Physiology or Medicine, and Economic Science.
          The prize was founded on the will of Alfred Nobel, which states that
          he bequeathed all of his "remaining realisable assets" to establish prizes awarded to
          "those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind".
          Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901 for five categories except for Economic Science.
          Not until 1968 was this category introduced and awarded.

          and industrialist most famously known for the invention of dynamite.
          Despite bringing him wealth, his inventions made war more devastating during that time.
          As a pacifist, he attempts to leave a better legacy 
          than having improved military weaponry through his ingenuity. That was why he devoted
          his assets to awarding anyone with enormous contributions to the world.
          Only a few days left until the 2022 Nobel prize ceremony, let's go through fascinating facts and statistics

              Over 120 years, there have been <b>976 people</b> from <b>75</b> countries all over the world
            being awarded Nobel Prizes. The map shows that approximately <b>40%</b> of the world

          <br>
        It is also visible that the <b>United States of America</b> outweighs all other countries with an impressive number of <b>283</b> Nobel Prize laureates.
      The <b>United Kingdom</b> and <b>Germany</b> are two outstanding European representatives with <b>90</b> and <b>85</b> Nobel winners, respectively. <b>France</b> follows these countries with <b>57</b> laureates and <b>Sweden</b> with <b>29</b> laureates.

                        Money prizes awarded to Nobel laureates are taken from the Nobel
                        Foundation.
                        This fund was established by Alfred Nobel's fortune, which was
                        <b>31 million SEK (c. US$ 280 million today)</b>.
                        The foundation's investments have become more profitable owing to the exemption from all taxes in Sweden since 1946 and investment taxes in the USA since 1953. 
                        In 2007, the fund amounted to
                        <b>3.628 billion SEK (c. US$ 600 million today)</b>.<br>
                        <br> The amount of prize money depends on how much money the foundation can award each year.
                        Moreover, the money prize is divided if there is prize share.
                        In <b>2009</b>, the monetary award per category was <b>10 million SEK (c. US$ 1.4 million today)</b> but decreased to <b>8 million SEK (c. US$ 1.4 million today)</b> in <b>2012</b>.
                        If two laureates share the prize in a category, the award grant is divided equally between the
                        recipients. If there are three laureates, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally or
                        awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.

                            Nobel laureates tend to devote most of their lives to pursuing their interested field.
                            Hence, it is visible that the overall median and average age of Nobel winners are between <b>60 and 70</b> years old.
                            However, this is different for each category. While the median age of laureates with Nobel prizes in such categories as <b>
                            Economic Sciences, Physiology or Medicine, Chemistry, and Literature</b> is <b>close to 60</b>, that of Nobel <b>Physics</b> laureates is close to 60.

                        suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.
                      Before her, <b>Lawrence Bragg</b> was the youngest awardee. He was only <b>25 years old</b> when he shared <b>Nobel Physics Prize</b> with his father
                    in 1915 for their services in analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays. </p>
